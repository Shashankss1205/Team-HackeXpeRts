226,42,226,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_226.mp3," I had told my husband that I wanted to grow a house. I did that and got the rate. But after 7-8 years, I got a stomach ache and got a stomach ache. After that, my consultant told me to take care of all the fields. Now I feel that if I take care of all the fields, I will be able to earn a good living. I feel that I have a small thing in my mind. I want to grow up and have children."
227,42,227,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_227.mp3, I felt that I was losing my life. I thought that I was suffering for so many days. I was not able to go back to my childhood. I was studying for a while. I was unable to see the moon. I was unable to see the moon. I was unable to see the moon. I realized that this is not the right cultivation method. Now something different happened.
228,42,228,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_228.mp3," I planned to do agriculture, agroforestry and animal husbandry. What did you do? I did agriculture, farm work, and animal husbandry. I did not do it alone. I did monocropping in Maraka. Single bed? Yes. I did multi cropping and integrated farming. I did it in a separate farm. I did agriculture, farm work, and other crops."
229,42,229,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_229.mp3,"em partisan global for our decoction. This is if, what I do, I do horticulture. It is Midterm."
230,42,230,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_230.mp3," It takes 10-15 years to grow. For example, if we grow it in a field, it can take 5-6 tons per year. It can be grown in a field. It can be L-49, Taiwan Pink, Taiwan White. If we grow it in a field, it can take 3 years. It can be Kesar, Dashari, Mallika, Banganpally. I have grown 4 varieties of mangoes. If we grow it in a field,"

Hetta's work would not come to the surface, I have made a lot of efforts to make this happen. I am telling everyone that I am making this happen in Karnataka. But we have been here for 15 years."
232,42,232,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_232.mp3," If we look at Sri Ganda, we will not be able to find him. Because we are all from the middle class. Our life is a struggle. That is not just a poem. All the farmers in Karnataka and India have been killed. Why I am saying this is because Sri Ganda is a parallel plant. In other crops, Sri Ganda is grown. So, if we want to grow another plant, we have to plant Sri Ganda and we have to plant it. That means Sri Ganda is a parallel plant. That means it is a parasite. It requires the host."
233,42,233,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_233.mp3," So, if we want to get a good host, we need to have good food for the shree gandha. We need to support the shree gandha and also make it productive. Yes, that is the only way to survive. How can we do the shree gandha for 12-15 years? For example, I asked a man who is 18-25 years old, what work do you do? I asked him to do farming. He said, I will ask you one question."
234,42,234,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_234.mp3," I heard that you are getting pension and retirement. Yes. This system that I have set for that is agriculture, horticulture, agroforestry and animal husbandry. Four combinations. Yes. We have made a plan of all the combinations. But at that time, there was no problem in getting me into the farming of Srikanth. I had thought about that. I have practically come to that success. I have come to Srikanth and I have entered the country."
235,42,235,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_235.mp3, I will show you the 9 year old Girdha The 9 year old Girdha is not even a single leaf Because the Girdha has many responsibilities It is a mixed matter You can take any leaf What is the rate of the Girdha What is the future What is the benefit What is the economic benefit
236,42,236,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_236.mp3," We have many answers to the questions of how to get rid of the disease. We have many answers to the questions of whether there is a solution or not. We have many answers to the questions of whether we should get confused. I will tell you what I have done for the farmers. We have done Ullagadi, Melasiinkai, Kabbu, Ragi, Batta. We have done everything. We have not seen a single crore per acre. That is the truth."
237,42,237,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_237.mp3," Another thing is, we are talking about Vala Mani, but you have not seen this much of pictures. This is a terrible truth. Why is it a terrible truth? Because you are famous on YouTube and Facebook, but you are not famous on YouTube and Facebook. YouTube and Facebook do not show such colorful pictures. It is very scary. This is a terrible truth."
238,42,238,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_238.mp3," I will talk about a tractor. For one thousand, it costs 800 to 900 rupees. For a cow, I will take one cow for work, it costs 1700 rupees. For a cow, it costs 500 rupees. For a hen, it costs 300 rupees. We don't even know if we have earned enough money. Because we don't get any money from the cow. We have to earn our own money. After doing all these circuses, what do we get in the end? We get our own income."
239,42,239,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_239.mp3, We have to count the crops because that is our livelihood. We have to count the crops that we have spent for the past few days. We have to count the crops that have been flopped. How many crops are you counting? We have to count the crops because the cost of cultivation is high and income is low. The agriculture is also high and income is low. Because they both are not proportional to each other. That is a very good question.
240,42,240,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_240.mp3," We should change it. The Prime Minister Narendra Modi says that in 2022 we should divide the right wing. If we divide the right wing by zero, it will become zero. It will become double zero. If we multiply zero into zero, it is zero only. It can't be infinite. If we want to make it infinite, this is the right time to think over it. This is the right time."
241,42,241,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_241.mp3," That's why I am saying that we should stop this. You have the youth in your hands. Because every year, people are getting up. Do you know the story of land being destroyed? That's how much it was. It was everywhere. If we want to remove the land, it should have started and the creativity should have come from the youngsters. Because we are done with this. You have all this in your hands. That's why I am telling you that this is agroforestry."
242,42,242,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_242.mp3," It has become the need of the day. What is the need? We calculate the MSP. Minimum supporting price is Bambala Bale. We consider the supporting price as the minimum Bambala Bale. What do you consider in that? You, the government, the people, the people. Our crops, our expenses, our oil and cow dung expenses. We calculate the total cost of that."
243,42,243,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_243.mp3," What about our land? You will say that you don't have land. You will cultivate your land. You will live in a single bedroom with a land of 500,000 rupees per square feet. Where will our land go? Where will our rental charges go? You will say that you have not been able to do anything for that. I will say that I have not been able to do anything for that."
244,42,244,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_244.mp3, No one is counting that now. I selected agroforestry to count that. I told you that this is a long term crop. We have been growing this for 12 to 15 years. That is how much our land has grown. It is dead in the last 15 years. I wanted to give a boost to the land and the body. That is why I supported agroforestry. Why I supported agroforestry is because I wanted to give a boost to the land.
245,42,245,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_245.mp3," We have to sleep for 15 years. If we want to sleep for 15 years, we have to have a strong soil. We have to have a good soil. For that, I have planted pears, mawa, and seed. Today, I have planted 2,000 srikanth in 8 acres of Hathugunta. I have planted 1,000 mawa, 600 pears, 600 seed, 100 black gram, 300 water lily, 100 black gram, 100 lemon, 100 karibewa, 100 nuggia, 100 coconut, and 800 saagwani gida. Singha"
246,42,246,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_246.mp3, Single square feet of your land should not be wasted. It has the value. What do you mean by value? I have done that. You may see it practically. Single square feet of your land should not be wasted. I am working on that. And I am working on the project to try to reduce the cost of cultivation. You are wasting your farming. You spent 10 lakhs and now you are not growing at all. How much will you get if you don't get 10 lakhs? 10 lakhs?
247,42,247,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_247.mp3," Why should we spend money on that? We should make sure that we have a good agriculture. We spent Rs.2 lakhs and got Rs.5 lakhs. That is profitable. We should change our thinking and vision. If I say that I will give you Rs.100 and sell it to the market, you should invest Rs.50 and invest Rs.50. I will give you another chance. You have invested Rs.50 in agriculture."
248,42,248,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_248.mp3," So, I say that earning is not important, saving is important. So, how to spend your land? Spend it and go with nature. You should not go against nature. But, you should go with it and do something to make a profit. I am trying to do that. Then, water. I knew the truth that water was my weakness. Where is this? In Rayachur. In Rayachur. I tried a lot."
249,42,249,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_249.mp3," I have never got that. Since I have known my weakness, I have been telling you this, Sitapala. Water, rice, groundnut, flour, all these are not good for water. I knew my weakness because I used to drink water from the well. The major non-crop in my crop is Sri Ganda. There is no oil in Sri Ganda that can be used to make milk. The more water you drink, the more oil content you get. That's all."
250,42,250,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_250.mp3," The reason is that the land is not for the gardener. It is for the forest. The reason for the forest is that it does not require special care and maintenance. It does not require water. It does not require any labor. So, the one who will provide the best quality of the land is the Karnataka Kiritas. That is why our doctor says that we should do it in a technical manner. We should not go for a very long time."
251,42,251,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_251.mp3," The help you give to the people should not be more than the amount given by the Lord. Because what happens if the help given is more than the amount given by the Lord? When we are praying to the Lord, there should be a person next to us who is the Lord of the Lord. If you are praying to the Lord, you should be the Lord of the Lord. Because the sun does not shine on that. Oh, that should not go up. Yes. There is no need to become a scientist for this. When the people of the world work, they show their own self. That is why I am a scientist."
252,42,252,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_252.mp3," I have not said that I am a pioneer in this field. I will say one thing, I have experienced it. I have experienced it in my 10 years of entry. I have told this to other farmers, I am a farmer. I have not been told to not to grow. I have explained it to them. I have learned it every day. I have been told to do this, to do this, to do water management, to do pest control."
253,42,253,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_253.mp3, I have been trying to balance my nutrition and give the best possible nutrition. I have been trying to do that. I have been following Facebook and Youtube and I have not achieved anything. You cannot grow mud in the soil. You cannot grow Shree Ganda. What do you mean by Shree Ganda? Nothing can grow in the soil. The soil must be covered with mud.
254,42,254,./audio_chunks/audio_42_chunk_254.mp3," You have to be ready for every stage. You have to be ready for the sun, the sun, the heat, the rain, the cold, the walk, and so on. If you are a big shot, you won't get the results. You can't even get the results with a person. If you do everything with a person, you will be with a person. If you work as a boss, you will be with a boss. That is my experience. I have practically faced this without understanding it."

461,200,461,./audio_chunks/audio_200_chunk_461.mp3, this is one of the protection if you put mesh on the ground it will not be able to move and it is not possible to move it why 5 feet to 8 feet it is because the smell is only 5 feet from the ground the smell of the ground is more and the smell of the ground is 5 feet from the ground so the smell of the ground is more

466,200,466,./audio_chunks/audio_200_chunk_466.mp3, and the number is 29 he will calculate the number and will take the cut as the number and will leave the chip part now how will your chip be traced chip is not that reliable if i put the chip and poke it it will completely lose that is what i am doing so that there is no problem with the chip
